       Welcome to PHPAdvocat
       ---------------------
Since I could'd find any free software to manage a lawyer's office
I decided to write it on my own. Inspired by PHPgroupware I tried to make it 
OS independend, though my favorite OS is Linux. 
I developed (and I am still developing) it on an AMD64 machine running 
Debian-AMD64 sarge with Apache2 and PHP5. For Database I choose PostgreSQL 
for its reliability and support of referential integrity. I also made a module 
to support Informix and MySQL but I couldn't test the Informix part yet.

In this project included are parts from 
   calendrier.php by Mathieu LESNIAK 
and
    fpdf by Olivier PLATHEY
Please refer to their Licence

PHPAdvocat ist still in an alpha statium so don't expect too much. I would be
glad of all help (suggestions, programms) I can get. Contact me on 
    phpadvocat@obergoeker.de 

For PHPAdvocat is distributed under GNU GPL you are free to copy an use it. 
But I can take no responsibility of the behaviour of this program or any 
effects which may occur.

INSTALL
-------
To install PHPAdvocat simply extract phpadvocat-x.x-x.tar.gz in your favorite 
Web-directory.
change into the sql subdirectory and create the desired database.

POSTGRESQL
----------
Then create a database "phpadvocat" and import the file pg-createdb.sql:

$createdb -E LATIN9  phpadvocat
CREATE DATABASE

If this leads to an error, your locale seems not to be set to an
appropriate value. In spite of setting your workspace you may create
your database with UTF8 ans importing the LATIN9 files in the folowing way:

$createdb  phpadvocat
CREATE DATABASE

$psql phpadvocat 
phpadvocat=# SET client_encoding = 'LATIN9';
SET

phpadvocat=# \i pg-createdb.sql
psql:pg-createdb.sql:17: NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence 'partner_number_seq' for SERIAL column 'partner.number'
psql:pg-createdb.sql:17: NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE/PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index 'pri_clients' for table 'partner'

...

Some mandatory data has to be addes by the scripts "mandatory.sql" and "kontenrahmen.sql". 
So, still logged into the phpadvocat database you may start this commands:

phpadvocat=# \i mandatory.sql
phpadvocat=# \i kontenrahmen-2007.sql

And for some demo data add the contents in "demo.sql"

phpadvocat=# \i demo.sql




MYSQL
-----
Create a database "phpadvocat" and import the file my-createdb.sql:

mysql -u root mysql
...

mysql> create database phpadvocat;
...
mysql> use phpadvocat
Database changed

mysql> \. my-createdb.sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

.....

And:

mysql> \. mandatory.sql
mysql> \. kontenrahmen-2007.sql
mysql> \. demo.sql


NOTICE: 
-------
PHPAdvocat identifies users by the underlying database, so create a 
PostgeSQL or MySQL user with sufficient rights to be able log in.

To use the Database have a look at ./include/phpadvocat.inc.php and set
correct $DBSERVER variable to [POSTGRESQL|MYSQL]

In order to use the LaTeX Document generation function correcktly, be
sure to have the texlive packets and the texlive extra utils (including
pdflatex).

Have Fun
